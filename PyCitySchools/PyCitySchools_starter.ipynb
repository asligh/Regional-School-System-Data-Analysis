    "the overall passing rate for Charter Schools is far better at 90.56% than the rate of 53.70% for District Schools.  The above visualization expands on previous analysis by the addition of \"School Count\", \"Student Count\", and \"Total Budget\" columns to gain further insight into the base-line data. As presented above, the budget for Charter Schools is around 12 mil compared to a District School budget of around 75.0 mil yet test scores are lower. There appears to be an underlying issue that money alone cannot fix which leads to consideration #2...\n",
    "\n",
    "Consideration #2: By analyzing the data in the columns \"Total School Count\" and \"Total Student Count\", one can observe that test scores go down as school size goes up. One may conclude that school size and test performance are inversely correlated. The number of students in the District school system stands at nearly 27,000 while the students in the charter system stands at a little over 12,000. Another interesting finding is that there is 1 less District School than Charter Schools. The issue potential overcrowding becomes apparent. In conclusion, because there are significantly more students in the District School system and 1 fewer school, test performance is diminished.  The addition of extra budgetary monies cannot alleviate the spacing / class size issue. The solution is to build more District Schools in order to increase the student-teacher ratio."
