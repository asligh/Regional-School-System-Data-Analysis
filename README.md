## PyCity Schools

Professional analysis of the district-wide standardized test results for the PyCity School system using student math and reading scores as well as budgetary data.  The data analysis solution encapusaltes the following deliverables using Pandas and Juypter Notebooks:

### District Summary

* High level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Solution Route

### Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* Table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing

### Math Scores by Grade

* Table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* Tablethat lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending
